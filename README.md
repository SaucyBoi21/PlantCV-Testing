# PlantCV-Testing

This repository is documenting my learning of the PlantCV library. This library is used for phenotyping given some image of the plant.

You can the run the repository with the following commands:

Windows

```
py -3 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

MacOS/Linux

```
python3 -m venv venv
.venv\bin\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can run the notebook in the IDE of your choice.
